Optimize site for search engines and accessibility standards.
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: -->
- The refactor project's intention was to update an existing website so that it is up to date with current accessibility standards and optimized for assistive technologies such as screen readers. 
- This creates an overall more ethical and constant user experience. 
- This was accomplished by updating current code to semantic html, relinking style sheet, and general bug fixes.
- I learned the importance of semantic html to make code look cleaner and more inclusive to the user experience.

<!-- - What was your motivation? -->
<!-- - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") -->
<!-- - What problem does it solve? -->
<!-- - What did you learn? -->
